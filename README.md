# Cat File Manager
</div>

![alt text](image.png)

This is a primarily linux-focused file manager inspired by Directory Opus (a paid file manager for Windows). It is currently heavily WIP, and is in no way meant to be for every day use just yet. Also, the code here is absolutely vile right now, due to me making lots of changes to the way it stores things during development, so any help fixing that up would be appreciated (ik no one is gonna help)

It's made in Python and using PySide6 for Qt stuff. I like that because it uses my plasma stuff along with everything else so it looks pretty :3
